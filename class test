The Headmaster is very angry on students, as she conducted a class test,she checks the marks of every student.

"such that if any student has a score equal to zero than, she orders "that student who scored zero and the student who checked his marks before him" should move out of the class".

So as per school norms, she need to submit the sum of the scores of the people who are in the class. 

Input :

First line T refers to no of testcases .

For each testcase there will we 2 lines on first line N refers number of the students in the class.

Next line give the marks of all the students in the class.

Output:

single line giving sum of all the marks of students in the  after verification.if sum seems to be larger then print sum%10^8

constraints:

1<=t<=100

1<=n<=100

1<=a[i]<=10000




program::

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	long int n, tc;
	cin >> tc;
	while (tc--)
	{
		long long int i, sum = 0, temp = 0, l;
		cin >> n;
		for (i = 0; i<n; i++)
		{
			cin >> l;
			if (l != 0)
				sum = sum + temp;
			temp = l;
		}
		cout << sum + temp << endl;
	}
}
