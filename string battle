By seeing the courage possesed by kranthi,the String king makes a treaty with kranthi by saying.

"If you solve this question you wii be set free...... and he contiues by saying.

Add the indexes of the string, if the same character appears again then multiply that patricular index with that character, if that product is high than apply mod 10.

Note: the string indexes always start with 1.

Input Format:

first line consists of no of testcases(t)

next t lines consists of string containing only digits.

 output Format:


print sum in a new line

Constraints:

1<=t<=100

1<=strlen<=10000

program::

#include <iostream>
#include<stdlib.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int tc;
    cin>>tc;
    while(tc--)
    {
    char *s;
    int a[10]={0},sum=0,x;
    int i=0;
    s=(char*)malloc(1000*sizeof(char));
    cin>>s;
    while(s[i]!='\0')
    {
        int x;
        x=s[i]-'0';
        if(a[x])
            sum=sum+((x*(i+1))%10);
        else
           {
               a[x]=1;
               sum=sum+x;
           }
           i++;
    }
    cout<<sum<<endl;
   }
}
